Hello and welcome to the small shell program!

To run this program, ensure that you have navigated to the directory that contains the Makefile and the main.c file contained in this folder.


After navigating to the directory where these files are located, enter the following into the terminal:
	gcc --std=gnu99 main.c -o smallsh

This will generate an executable file named 'smallsh' in the same directory as the main.c file. To then run the program, please enter into the terminal:
	./smallsh

This will run the executable file. You will be prompted by a colon (:) to enter commands. This shell can run basic linux commands, and has three build in commands:

enter 'exit' to quit the shell.

Enjoy the program!
